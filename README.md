# M1 Collections Map Solution

You need to implement the following tasks:
1. Write a method to test if a Map<Integer, String> contains a key for the specified value. Values should contain the days of the week. The method should return a string containing the elements of the map, separated by a space.
2. Write a method to get a collection view of the values contained in the Map<Integer, String>. Values should contain the days of the week. The method should return a string containing "Collection view is: " and the elements of the map, separated by a space.
3. Write a method to get a set view of the keys contained in the Map<Integer, String>. Values should contain the days of the week. The method should return a string containing "Key set values are: " and the elements of the map, separated by a space.
4. Write a method to sort keys in a TreeMap<String, Integer> by the length of the key (DESC). Keys should contain "Red", "Green", "Orange", "Pink" colors. The method should return a string containing the elements of the map in reverse order, separated by a space.
5. Write a method that takes a Map <Integer, String> as input and returns a Map where the keys and values are swapped. The method should return a string containing the elements of the map, separated by a space.
